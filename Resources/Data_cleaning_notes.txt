Cleaning crash statistics file using excel:
1. Removed unnecessary columns to make dataset smaller.
2. Removed km/hr after all numbers in speed zone column using find and replace in excel. Therefore, the data was changed from string to numeric format.
3. Sorted the dataset alphabetically  for local government agency (LGA) using excel.


Cleaning lge files:
1. Deleted all the columns that did not have data about length of road or expediture associated with the roads.
2. Deleted a few rows from top that had no data. Deleted 3 rows after Yarriambiack lge to remove some calculations present in dataset. The calculations were mostly the sum of each columns.  
3. Removed parenthesis and letters with it from lge column so we can join this dataset with crash statistics dataset.
4. This file is sorted alphabetically. So, no need to sort it.
5. Renames columns to avoid duplicate column names.
