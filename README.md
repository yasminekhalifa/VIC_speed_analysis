 ROAD INCIDENTS ACROSS VICTORIA

 Road statistics are well reported, but are there trends and relationships around preventative measures such as speed limit restrictions, road upgrades and road safety    cameras.  We will be asking which one is the most effective at preventing incidents and what type of incidents.  

 We will be diving into the data to see if our hypothesis that road upgrades are likely to be the most effective.

 Key questions to be considered are:

 Is there a correlation between the number and type of road incidents and the speed limit?  Eg - Fatalities / Serious injury / Minor or no injury as classified by VicRoads.
 Does local government spending improve road conditions to prevent incidents?
 Does the overall demographics (age / average income / gender) of local government areas have an impact on the number of incidents?
 Do speed camera locations actually decrease crash numbers within a radius of 1km from the incidents v those outside 1 km of the speed camera?
